S3cp

s3cp - Amazon S3 command line cp program

"As a user of Amazon's S3 service for hosting files and storing backups I've longed for a simple command line copy progam. s3cp is the result." - Brad Lucas

S3cp works like the Unix cp program allowing you to put files into S3 or to retrieve them from the command line.
