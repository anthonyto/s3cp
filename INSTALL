Basic Installation
==================

Unpack the downloaded zip or tar.gz file. 

The dist folder will contain the compiled application as s3cp-cmdline.jar.

You need a java virtual machine installed, for both compiling and starting s3cp.

Next, cd into /s3cp/dist and enter from the command-line the following:

java -jar s3cp-cmdline.jar -h

You'll get the command line syntax.


Amazon Keys
===========

Before you can interact with your S3 account you need to setup a file
with your access and secret key. 

Create a directory called .s3cp under your home directory.

Inside the directory create a file called s3cp.properties

In the s3cp.properties file create the following entries:

s3.accessKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE
s3.secretKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE


ALIAS
=====

There is a script called s3cp.sh in ~/s3cp/src/scripts that you setup 
with an alias. 

First, edit the s3cp.sh and change the INSTALL_PATH setting to the path 
where you installed s3cp.

Second, edit the following with the correct path and put in your .bashrc file

alias s3cp=$HOME/work/s3cp/src/scripts/s3cp.sh

With that, s3cp will run from the command line through the alias.


USAGE
=====

s3cp uses a URI syntax to reference the objects in your S3 account. For example,

if you have a bucket called test-files with an object tmp/test.sh you'd be
able to get it from S3 with the following command.

$ scp s3://test-files/tmp/test.sh test.sh



Copy to S3 [PUT]

    $ s3cp local-file s3://bucket/object[/]

    If object has a trailing slash it will be assumed to mean a directory and the local-file's filename will be appended to object.

Copy from S3 [GET]

    $ s3cp s3://bucket/object [local-file]


    If local-file is not present a filename from object will be used in the current directory.



MULITPLE S3 ACCOUNTS
====================

If you have multiple S3 accounts you can enter each account's keys with the following syntax


account-name-1.s3.accessKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE
account-name-1.s3.secretKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE


account-name-2.s3.accessKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE
account-name-2.s3.secretKey=YOUR-VALUE-HERE


Then use the -a account-name option from the command line.

For example,


Copy from S3 [GET]

    $ s3cp -a account-name-1 s3://bucket/object [local-file]
